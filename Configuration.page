# Configuring the Jenkins Build Breaker Lights

### Step 1: Log in to the Sybil server

`$ ssh sybil-config@sybil.synyx.coffee`  
The password is: `sybil-config`

### Step 2: Edit the file `jenkins.json`

#### Step 2.1

`$ vim jenkins.json`  
or  
`$ nano jenkins.json`  

#### Step 2.2

Now you will see a file that looks similar to this:

```
{
  "https://jenkins.example.com": [
    {"name": "example1-build", "ledstrip": "example1"},

    {"name": "example2", "ledstrip": "example2"}
  ],
  "http://jenkins2.example.com": [
    {"name": "example3", "ledstrip": "example3"},
  ]
}
```

The highest level elements beginning with `http` or `https` are references to the Jenkins servers.  
**Do not edit them, the servers are configured elsehwere.**  

Each server has an array of objects which configure which jobs from this server are shown on which ledstrip:

`{"name": "example1", "ledstrip": "example1"}`  
http://doc.sybil.synyx.coffee/_edit/Configuration
* `name` is the name of the jobs as it is in Jenkins.  
* `ledstrip` is the name of the LED strip on which to show the job status on, as configured in `ledstrips.json`.

Edit, add to or remove these lines as necessary, making sure to keep the same format and that the file is valid JSON. Use whitespace to keep the file easily readable.

#### Step 2.3

Save the file and exit the editor. In vim type `:wq`, in nano press `Ctrl+O Ctrl+X`.

### Step 3: Load the new configuration

Run

`$ ./reloadJenkinsConfig.sh`

If everything went right, the program will output something similar to this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 20 Mar 2015 12:27:19 GMT
Server: Jetty(9.2.9.v20150224)
Content-Length: 0
Via: 1.1 api.sybil.example.com
Connection: close
```

This means the configuration was loaded correctly.

If you see output beginning with  
`HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error`  
or  
`HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict`  
something went wrong and the configuration was not loaded. The old configuration is still active.

Hopefully there should be a helpful error message, explaining what went wrong.  
Most likely you made a mistake editing the file `jenkins.json`. You should go back and make sure it is valid JSON and conforms to the format in the example above.

# Configuring Jenkins servers

The Jenkins servers are configured in `/home/sybil/jenkinsservers.json`, and it looks something like this:

```
[
  { "url": "https://jenkins1.example.com", "user": "sybil", "key": "malcolmreynolds"},
  { "url": "http://jenkins2.example.com", "user": "sybil", "key": "jamestkirk"},
]
```

Let's break this down:

* `url` is the base URL under which the Jenkins server runs. Note that it must begin with either `http://` or `https://`, depending on its SSL support. It must not end with a slash(`/`)!  
These are the same URLs as in the `jenkins.json` where they are used as identifiers. **If you change a URL here, you have to change it there, too!**
* `user` is a user that has read access to the API.
* `key` is the user's API key, which can be found on the user's *Configure* page under *API Token*.

# Configuring Tinkerforge Hardware

The hardware configuration is in `bricks.json`, `ledstrips.json`, and `relays.json` in `/home/sybil-config/`.  

## Bricks

`bricks.json` looks something like this:

```
[
  {"name": "indybrick", "hostname": "synerforge001", "uid": "6e6uJ7"},
  {"name": "adminbrick", "hostname": "synerforge002", "uid": "5VjXYE", "port": 4223}
]
```

This should be pretty self-explanatory.

## Bricklets

**Note that all bricklets' names must be unique!**

### LED Strips

`ledstrips.json` looks something like this:

```
[
  {
    "name": "indy",
    "uid": "p3c",
    "length": 30,
    "brick": "synerforge001",
    "okayRed": 0, "okayGreen": 16, "okayBlue": 0,
    "warningRed": 127, "warningGreen": 127, "warningBlue": 0,
    "criticalRed": 127, "criticalGreen": 0, "criticalBlue": 0
  },
  {
    "name": "admin",
    "uid": "p3B",
    "length": 31,
    "brick": "synerforge002"
  }
]
```

Let's go through this:

* `name` is the name under which the LED strip is addressed, for example in the `jenkins.json` configuration file (see above).
* `uid` is the unique ID of the LED Strip bricklet, it can be found through the Tinkerforge brickviwer (`brickv`).
* `length` is the number of LEDs on the Strip.
* `brick` is the name of the brick (configured above) to which the LED Strip bricklet is connected.
* `okay*`, `warning*`, and `critical*` are *optional* and allow to set the colors of the different states to whatever you like.

### Relays

`relays.json` looks something like this:

```
[
  {"name": "relayone", "uid": "rAL", "brick": "relaybrick"},
  {"name": "relaytwo", "uid": "fBc", "brick": "relaybrick"}
]
```

This is analogous to the LED Strip configuration, only with less options.

# Restarting Sybil

If you change any file other than `jenkins.json` you have to restart the server.  
To do that go to the [Tomcat manager](http://api.sybil.synyx.coffee/manager/html) and login with username `sybil` and password `ramkin`. Then click on the "Reload"-Button for the Application with the `/` path.

# Servers

Sybil runs on `sybil.synyx.coffee` on a tomcat server in /home/sybil/tomcat/, this wiki runs on the user `sybil` user in a screen named `gitit`.

## Restarting the Wiki

If you change the wiki's config file (`/home/sybil/doc/wiki.conf`) or template files (anything in `/home/sybil/doc/templates/`) you will have to restart the wiki.  
To do that, enter the gitit screen (`screen -r gitit`), press Ctrl+C to kill the server and then run `./runwiki.sh` to start the server.
