# Configuring the Jenkins Build Breaker Lights

### Step 1: Log in to the Sybil server

`$ ssh sybil-config@sybil.synyx.coffee`  
The password is: `sybil-config`

### Step 2: Edit the file `jenkins.json`

#### Step 2.1

`$ vim jenkins.json`  
or  
`$ nano jenkins.json`  

#### Step 2.2

Now you will see a file that looks similar to this:

```
{
  "https://jenkins.example.com": [
    {"name": "example1-build", "ledstrip": "example1"},

    {"name": "example2", "ledstrip": "example2"}
  ],
  "http://jenkins2.example.com": [
    {"name": "example3", "ledstrip": "example3"},
  ]
}
```

The highest level elements beginning with `http` or `https` are references to the Jenkins servers.  
**Do not edit them, the servers are configured elsehwere.**  

Each server has an array of objects which configure which jobs from this server are shown on which ledstrip:

`{"name": "example1", "ledstrip": "example1"}`  

* `name` is the name of the jobs as it is in Jenkins.  
* `ledstrip` is the name of the LED strip on which to show the job status on, as configured in `ledstrips.json`.

Edit, add to or remove these lines as necessary, making sure to keep the same format and that the file is valid JSON. Use whitespace to keep the file easily readable.

#### Step 2.3

Save the file and exit the editor. In vim type `:wq`, in nano press `Ctrl+O Ctrl+X`.

### Step 3: Load the new configuration

`$ ./reloadJenkinsConfig.sh`

If everything went right, the program will output something similar to this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 20 Mar 2015 12:27:19 GMT
Server: Jetty(9.2.9.v20150224)
Content-Length: 0
Via: 1.1 api.sybil.example.com
Connection: close
```

This means the configuration was loaded correctly.

If there is a bigger output, beginning with  
`HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error`  
and a lot of HTML and Java in it, something went wrong and the configuration was not loaded. The old configuration is still active.

Most likely you made a mistake editing the file `jenkins.json`. You should go back and make sure it is valid JSON and conforms to the format in the example above.
