# Adding a new light

See [OpenHAB Configuration]() and add a new light, naming it light `lightXX` with `XX` being taken from this map:

![Map of office lights](/office_lights_source.svg)

As long as all the new lights are correctly named and correspond to the map, the light switch UI should just work!
