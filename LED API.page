title: LED API

# Introduction

The LED Strips have an API that allows direct access to the LEDs. The API can be accessed under:  
`http://api.sybil.synyx.coffee/configuration/ledstrips/{ledstripname}/display`

# Examples

For these examples we use a LED Strip with just 3 LEDs called `admin`, which means the endpoint is at:  
`/configuration/ledstrips/admin/display`

## GET

GETting the endpoint returns something like this:

> Status → 200 OK  
> Content-Type → application/hal+json

---

```json
[
  {
    "red": 0,
    "green": 0,
    "blue": 0
  },
  {
    "red": 0,
    "green": 0,
    "blue": 0
  },
  {
    "red": 0,
    "green": 0,
    "blue": 0
  }
]
```

---

Here all Pixels are black.

## PUT

You can update the whole LED Strip by PUTting something to it, like this:

---

```json
[
  {
    "red": 255,
    "green": 0,
    "blue": 0
  },
  {
    "red": 0,
    "green": 255,
    "blue": 0
  },
  {
    "red": 0,
    "green": 0,
    "blue": 255
  }
]
```

---

This sets the first pixel to red, the second to green, and the third to blue, while setting the brightness to 1/3 of the maximum.
