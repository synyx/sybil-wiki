# Introduction

Sybil uses the [Tinkerforge platform](http://www.tinkerforge.com/).

The typical [stack](http://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Primer.html#primer-stack) consists of a [Master Brick](http://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricks/Master_Brick.html) and an [Ethernet Extension](http://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Master_Extensions/Ethernet_Extension.html#ethernet-extension) with at least one [Bricklet](http://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Primer.html#primer-bricklets).

## Bricklets

Sybil so far supports these bricklets:

* [LED Strip Bricklet](http://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricklets/LED_Strip.html#led-strip-bricklet)
## LED Stack

A LED Stack consists of:

* A Master Brick
* An Ethernet Extension
* A LED Strip bricklet with connected LED Strip
* A [PSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable) [Power socket](http://www.dx.com/p/repair-parts-replacement-power-socket-port-for-psp-1000-13261) connected to the LED Strip bricklet's power input.

Why a PSP power socket? Because [these cables](http://www.dx.com/p/usb-data-and-charging-cable-for-psp-3000-2000-1000-110cm-length-28732) exist, which provide Mini-USB (for the Master brick) and a barrel connector (for the LED Strip) at once. This is the most convenient method for powering both the LED strip and the Master brick.

### Pictures
It looks like this:

From bottom to top these are:

* A Master Brick with a Mini-USB cable connected for power.
* An Ethernet Extension with an Ethernet cable connected for data.
* A LED Strip bricklet with the LED Strip and a PSP power cable connected.

A picture from the top without the data and power connectors:

This shows the PSP power connector and the 1m LED strip.
