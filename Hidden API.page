#LED Strips

## Introduction

The LED Strips have an API that allows direct access to the LEDs. The API can be accessed under:  
`http://api.sybil.synyx.coffee/configuration/ledstrips/{ledstripname}/display`

## Examples

For these examples we use a LED Strip with just 3 LEDs called `admin`, which means the endpoint is at:  
`/configuration/ledstrips/admin/display`

### GET

GETting the endpoint returns something like this:

> Status → 200 OK  
> Content-Type → application/hal+json

---

    {
      "pixels": [
        {
          "red": 0,
          "green": 0,
          "blue": 0
        },
        {
          "red": 0,
          "green": 0,
          "blue": 0
        },
        {
        "red": 0,
        "green": 0,
        "blue": 0
        }
      ],
      "brightness": 1,
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "http://api.sybil.synyx.coffee/configuration/ledstrips/admin/display"
        }
      }
    }

---

Here all Pixels are black and the brightness is at maximum.

### PUT

You can update the whole LED Strip by PUTting something to it, like this:

---

    {
      "pixels":
      [
        {
          "red": 255,
          "green": 0,
          "blue": 0
        },
        {
          "red": 0,
          "green": 255,
          "blue": 0
        },
        {
          "red": 0,
          "green": 0,
          "blue": 255
        }
      ],
      "brightness": 0.333
    }

---

This sets the first pixel to red, the second to green, and the third to blue, while setting the brightness to 1/3 of the maximum.

### PATCH

PATCHing the endpoint allows for more fine-grained manipulation of the LEDs.

    {
      "patches":
      [
        {
          "action": "set",
          "target": "fill",
          "values": [
            "0",
            "0",
            "0"
          ]
        },
        {
          "action": "set",
          "target": "pixel",
          "values": [
            "0",
            "127",
            "127",
            "127"
          ]
    
        },
        {
          "action": "set",
          "target": "pixel",
          "values": [
            "2",
            "0",
            "0",
            "127"
          ]
    
        },
        {
          "action": "set",
          "target": "brightness",
          "values": [
            ".5"
          ]
        },
        {
          "action": "update",
          "target": "display"
        }
      ]
    }

---

This sets all pixels to black, THEN sets pixel 1 to white, THEN sets pixel 3 to blue, THEN sets the brightness to half maximum, and FINALLY updates the display, e.g. shows the changes that were made.  
**That last part is especially important!** Without it, nothing would show on the LED Strip.

This leaves us with just one command left to demonstrate, but possibly the most interesting.

---

    {
      "patches":
      [
        {
          "action": "move",
          "target": "pixels",
          "values": [
            "1"
          ]
    
        },
        {
          "action": "update",
          "target": "display"
        }
      ]
    }

---

This moves all the pixels one pixel away from the brick. Any pixels that reach the end of the strip appear at the start. This also works for negative values.
