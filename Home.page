# Getting Started

Sybil currently runs only one service: Jenkins Build Breaker Lights.  
This means it is showing the state (Success, Unstable, or Failed) of a Jenkins job as a color on a LED strip.

[Configuring the Jenkins Build Breaker Lights](Configuration)  

# Editing this wiki

This wiki uses Pandoc to create it's pages. For further information on supported markup languages, see [Help](). The default is Markdown with [Pandoc Extensions](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown) but without syntax-highlighting.

## Accounts

To edit, you need an account. There is - as of yet - no connection to LDAP, so you have to create an account here.
