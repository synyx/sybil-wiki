# Introduction

Sybil currently runs three services: **Jenkins Build Breaker Lights**, **LED Control**, & **Relay Control**.

* Jenkins Build Breaker Lights means it is showing the state (Success, Unstable, or Failed) of a Jenkins job as a color on a LED strip.  
* LED Control allows controlling said LED strips directly over a web API.  
* Relay Control allows the switching of relays and thus any electronic device over a web API.
