# Getting Started

Sybil currently runs only one service: Jenkins Build Breaker Lights.  
This means it is showing the state (Succes, Unstable, or Failed) of a Jenkins job as a color on a LED strip.

## Configuring the Jenkins Build Breaker Lights

The configuration files follow [these schemata](https://github.com/synyx/sybil/tree/master/src/docs/configfiles).

To change which Jenkins jobs are displayed on which LED strips, log in to the user `sybil-config` (password is the same as the username) on `sybil.synyx.coffee`. Then edit the file `jenkins.json`.

This is an array of objects with the properties `name` (the Jenkins job name) and `ledstrip` (the name of the ledstrip), e.g. ``{"name": "job_example_one", "ledstrip": "indy"}``.  255
Make sure it's valid JSON: Don't forget to end every line of the array - *except the last one* - with a comma.

When you are done, run `./reloadJenkinsConfig.sh`.

## Low Level Stuff

Sybil runs on `sybil.synyx.coffee` on the user `sybil` in a screen named `sybil`, this wiki runs on the same user in a screen named `gitit`.

If you change the `bricks.json` or `ledstrips.json` configuration files (in /home/sybil-config/) you have to restart the server.  
To do that, enter the sybil screen (`screen -r sybil`), press Enter to stop the server and once you are back on the shell type `./run.sh` to start the server.

If you change the wiki's config file (`/home/sybil/doc/wiki.conf`) or template files (anything in `/home/sybil/doc/templates/`) you will have to restart the wiki.  
To do that, enter the gitit screen (`screen -r gitit`), press Ctrl+C to kill the server and then run `./runwiki.sh` to start the server.

# Editing this wiki

This wiki uses Pandoc to create it's pages. For further information on supported markup languages, see [Help](). The default is Markdown with [Pandoc Extensions](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown) but without syntax-highlighting.

## Accounts

To edit, you need an account. There is - as of yet - no connection to LDAP, so you have to create an account here.
