# Sybil

## Introduction

Sybil currently runs two services: **Jenkins Build Breaker Lights**, **LED Control**.

* Jenkins Build Breaker Lights means it is showing the state (Success, Unstable, or Failed) of a Jenkins job as a color on a LED strip.  
* LED Control allows controlling said LED strips directly over a HTTP API.
